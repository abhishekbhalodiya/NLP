Its widespread cultivation with the assistance of negro-slaves made it one of the most important export items in the American economy. Tobacco was also grown in other parts of the world, including Burma and Cuba. Cigarettes made of tobacco rolled in tissue paper aided in the spread of a very harmful habit among the Westâ€™s so-called advanced countries. It then spread to various other countries around the world. Attractive packaging and expert advertising aided in spreading the addiction to smoking cigarettes even among the poorest segments of the population.\"\n"
